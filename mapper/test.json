My concern isn’t so much with the appearance or instructors personally, it is with the covid policies FSC as a whole has implemented and how the classroom instruction is handled. Several of my courses we are forced into groups of 4 and mainly doing group work while the delta variant still continues to rapidly spread. My husband is immune compromised but I still have to participate in these groups while the instructors are able to stand behind the plexiglass they are provided to keep them safe. Furthermore there is little social distancing in classes as students are side by side at the same tables. The FSC cares plan also allows for students who are vaccinated but asymptotic to be in school and not quarantine even if testing positive. How is this right?? I’m disappointed with how the school is handling the safety of students as well as the loved ones that students are going home to (especially when commuting).",
